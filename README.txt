To convert your image to a Terraria schematic, simple place the image in this folder, and run SchematicMaker.exe

It will ask you if you would like to keep true black pixels as blank tiles, this means that instead of using a png with transparent pixels you can simply make 
the "air tiles" black.

If you just want a dark colour, you can either respond with N or just use a colour that isn't #000000. (#000001 would be fine)
